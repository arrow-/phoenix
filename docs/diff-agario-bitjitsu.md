# Difference between agar.io and Bit-Jitsu

+ You can control each of the blobs **independently**.

+ You cannot hide under a virus.

+ You cannot feed a virus and spawn a new virus, feeding a virus does nothing.

+ The mass of the eject is exactly two units unlike `agar.io` where you loose
10% of your mass after an eject.

+ Unlike FFA mode (free for all) in agar.io, your game runs for fixed number of iterations
and all the bots start with equal initial mass.

+ agar.io has `14242 X 14242` square map but map of `Bit-Jitsu` is 16:9
`4992 X 2808`.

+ The split operation results in to equal halves unlike `agar.io`.

+ You can merge your blobs when ever you want unlike `agar.io` where there is
a minimum time before you can merge your bots.

+ You will not split into multiple blobs after eating a virus given that the number
of blobs is less than 16 like you do in agar.io, instead you will split into two if
the number of blobs for your bot is less than 16.

+ The eject mass operation happens in a direction opposite of current direction
unlike `agar.io`
