# Game Mechanics

+ radius of anything = (mass / 2) units
+ decay of cell = (0.002 * mass) units s<sup>-1</sup>
+ Minimum mass for split = 36 units
+ After split parent moves in opposite direction, child moves in the direction the parent was moving
+ After a split the mass of both the children are the same
+ Distance travelled after split with respect to both the radiuses = 700 + r units
+ mass of virus = 70 units
+ initial mass of cell = 20 units
+ Minimum mass for eating a virus = 130 units
+ Speed of a cell = 2.2 * (mass <sup>-0.439</sup>) units s<sup>-1</sup>
+ Maximum children = 16
+ Number of viruses are fixed for a map. If a virus is eaten then it re-emerges imediately.
+ Map dimensions (16:9) = 4992 X 2808 units <sup>2<sup>
+ Each food mass = 2 units
+ Each eject mass = 2 units
+ Mass eject happens in the direction opposite of motion
+ minimim mass of cell to eject mass = 20 units
+ condition for eating anything(food, virus, cells) = hunter must be 80% bigger than the prey
+ 1 tick = 20 s
